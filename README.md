I'm Marinos Pierides, a Computer Science student at the University of Portsmouth with a strong interest in software engineering, cloud computing, and problem-solving through code. I enjoy building practical projects that apply what I learn in class to real-world challenges.

Iâ€™m constantly expanding my skills in Python, Java, and web technologies, and Iâ€™m especially curious about areas like artificial intelligence, DevOps, and scalable systems. Iâ€™ve also been exploring version control (Git/GitHub), agile workflows, and cloud platforms like AWS.

Outside of academics, I enjoy collaborating with others on tech projects, improving my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and staying updated with the latest industry trends. My goal is to become a well-rounded software developer and contribute to impactful tech solutions.
