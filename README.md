# Marinos Pierides

I'm a **Computer Science student** at the **University of Portsmouth** with a  interest in  **cloud computing**, and solving real-world problems through code as a first year student.

I enjoy building practical projects that apply what I learn in class, and I'm actively developing my skills in:

- Python   
- Algorithms and data structures  
- Git/GitHub and agile workflows  
- Cloud platforms like AWS  


Outside of academics, I like collaborating on tech projects, staying updated with the latest industry trends, and growing into a well-rounded software developer focused on impact and innovation.
